# Block-Shooter-Game
**Block Shooter** is a  2D "top-down" shooter game created using Unity (originally in the 2019 version, but it has been updated to 2020).<br/><br/>
**NOTE:** The BS_Game.app is the "PC, Mac & Linux Standalone" build that is generated by Unity. Hence, you can click on the .app file to this to play the game on PCs and Macs. 

**Instructions:** 
- Once the BS_Game file has been opened, you will come across the main menu which has a Start, Instructions and Quit button. 
- You can visit the ***Instructions*** to learn more about how to play, but the game design is quite clean and easy to use, so playing directly should not be a problem.
- As of right now, there are **10** playable levels present in the game.
