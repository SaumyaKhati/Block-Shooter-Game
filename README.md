# Block-Shooter-Game
This is a 2D "block" shooter game that I created using Unity. 
**NOTE:** The BS_Game.app is the "PC, Mac & Linux Standalone" build that is generated by Unity. Hence, you can use the .app file to this to play the game on PCs and Macs.

**Instructions:** 
- Once downloaded, you will come across the main menu which has a Start, Instructions and Quit button. 
- You can visit the Instructions in the game to learn about how to play, but in my opinion the game design is quite clean and easy to use so playing directly should not be a problem.
- As of right now, there are 10 playable levels present in the game.
